## What we are doing

- Piloting and evaluating a new method, The Roanoke Method, of resilience planning, which is a grassroots process of deep community engagement that starts with youth and the organizations that work with youth in the City of Roanoke, and takes into account trauma-informed, healing centered principles
- Producing repeatable youth programs in arts, spirituality, and STEM that connect to the Cityâ€™s urban planning processes
- Training 8 high school students that identify with the African American community in Roanoke in community planning, so they can plan for futures of their own neighborhoods
- Building a website to host all products of the project and show how they connect to community plans for the future
