## Trauma and Healing

In the realm of urban planning, acknowledging the intersections of individual and collective trauma becomes pivotal for fostering inclusive and resilient communities that promote the healing and empowerment of residents. In this project, we embrace trauma-informed, healing-centered approaches through a deep recognition of historical and ongoing systemic marginalization, poverty, and displacement and the upcoming urban challenges that communities will face amidst changing climate conditions. We believe that our efforts should be focused on collaborative knowledge co-creation with community leaders and the incorporation of healing-centered approaches in designing urban spaces that support holistic healing. In this approach, we underscore the need to create urban city spaces by prioritizing community engagement, safety, equity, and choice. Additionally, we wish to not only recognize physical sites of collective trauma but also strive to ensure that existing and future physical infrastructure supports a sense of belonging in the community. In adopting a trauma-informed urban planning process, we advocate that the reparation of historical planning and policy harms should be rooted in amends, recognition, respect, and reform.
