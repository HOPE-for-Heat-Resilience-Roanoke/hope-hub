Climate change is increasing the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves and is expected to increase their impact on human health and the economy. Community planning interventions can help communities stay cool. Community planning interventions can include:

- Community-recognized resilience hubs - which might provide safe air conditioned spaces to stay, access to water, and shade
- Increased green infrastructures - such as park spaces, trees, and vegetation
- Other public infrastructure improvements, such as cool pavements, splash pads, and shade infrastructure to help people stay cool outdoors
- Public education and information about the risks of heat and resources
- Coordination with emergency services

However, community capacity and trust must be built in a way that recognizes lived experiences of historically marginalized communities.

In 2020, the City of Roanoke conducted an [urban heat mapping campaign](https://www.roanokeva.gov/2722/Roanokes-Heat-Island-Mapping). This map shows that there may be temperature differences of >10 degrees F across the city. The hottest areas of the City are those that are impacted by many other social and environmental stressors.
