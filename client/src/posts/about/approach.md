## The *H.O.P.E.* Approach

***H.O.P.E.*** **stands for Healing Our People with Empathy**. In the planning phase of our project, we realized that the communities that are most vulnerable to the risks of increased temperatures are also the communities that must simultaneously deal with many other social and environmental stressors: poverty, lack of affordable housing, food insecurity, policing and mass incarceration, and gun violence, to name a few. With such pressing issues in people'sâ€™ day-to-day lives, how do we simultaneously raise longer-term, and perhaps less recognized, impacts of the impacts of climate change, which are already making many of these issues worse?

The project aims to create social and digital infrastructures for community resilience to extreme heat through deploying youth technology, arts, and urban planning programs in partnership with city government and existing community development and faith organizations.
