***H.O.P.E. for Heat Resilience*** is a collaboration between community groups, City government, and academic researchers in Roanoke, Virginia to address the risks of rising temperatures in the city caused by global climate change.

The project is one of [19 projects](https://nsfcivicinnovation.org/civic-2022-stage-2-awardees/) nationwide funded by the National Science Foundation Civic Innovation Challenge.

Our project aims to demonstrate a grassroots and youth-centered approach to community planning for the risks of climate change in cities. In addition, our collaboration is defining what trauma-informed, healing-centered urban planning means in the context of history and coming challenges of global climate change.
