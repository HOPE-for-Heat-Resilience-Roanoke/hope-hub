## Project Challenge

Climate change is increasing the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves and is expected to increase their impact on human health and the economy. Urban planning interventions can help communities stay cool. However, community capacity and trust must be built in a way that recognizes lived experiences of historically marginalized communities. The project aims to create social and digital infrastructures for community resilience to extreme heat through deploying youth technology, arts, and urban planning programs in partnership with city government and existing community development and faith organizations.
